# Hello! ðŸ‘‹
My name is Felix Katzenberg and I am 21 years old. Born and living in Germany, I am passionate about computer science and gliding. In between studying and gliding, I run my own homelab with lots of software and a smart home for me and my family. Although gliding gets me away from the keyboard, I also love to create something with my own hands and blood, which will be reflected in some blog posts that do not necessarily have a computer background.

Feel free to check out my blog and portfolio.

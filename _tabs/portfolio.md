# DIY Projects

<b><u>Upgrading the 1-DIN to a 2-DIN radio in a 2001 SLK</u></b>
: **Short Description**: In this time and age everything needs to have a display. Don't understand me wrong, I like buttons that are easy to reach with muscle memory while driving, but I also like Apple CarPlay or a self-sufficient resolution like Teslas with their own SIM-cards and the ability to play from your favorite music streaming service without the need of a phone. Therefore the idea of a new modern radio and a complete overhaul of the middle console was born.

<b><u>Smart LED IKEA 5x5 Kallax</u></b>
: **Short Description**: After building the IKEA inspired bar, as a computer scientist, light was still missing. Using WS2812 LED stript, metal profiles, a Sonoff S26 and a ESP32 I electrified the shelf and made every single LED individually assignable, turning it into a eye catcher whenever entering the room.

<b><u>IKEA Kallax Bar</u></b>
: **Short Description**: As the old bar in the basement surely lost its charm and therefore fell victim to time, there was a need for a replacement. After an evaluation of multiple options a promising solution using IKEA Kallax shelfs started to develop. No sooner said than done and the shelfs were picked up the next day.
